# Blinkit Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. Using Python for data processing and Power BI for visualization, we uncover key insights and optimization opportunities through various KPIs and interactive charts.

## Business Requirements
The analysis focuses on:
- Understanding total sales, average sales per transaction, item diversity, and customer ratings.
- Examining key influencing factors like fat content, item type, outlet characteristics, and geographical distribution.
- Creating actionable insights using Power BI visualizations.

## KPIs Implemented
1. **Total Sales** – Overall revenue generated from all items sold.
2. **Average Sales** – Average revenue per sale.
3. **Number of Items** – Total count of different items sold.
4. **Average Rating** – Average customer rating for items sold.

## Visualizations in Python using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries
The following charts help analyze sales trends and insights:

| **Chart** | **Objective** | **Chart Type** |
